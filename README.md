Tasks in course

This repository was created to add laptops with solved tasks from the skillfactory. 
The first stage: convolutional neural networks have been studied. 
Convolutional layers with a different number of filters, as well as a convolution core that passes through the layer like a flashlight, a dropout that protects the model from overfitting, a flatten that pulls the layer into a single vector, as well as fully connected layers. 
Activation functions such as sigmoid and Rely, Elu have also been studied.
